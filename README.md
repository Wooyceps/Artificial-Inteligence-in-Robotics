# Artificial Intelligence in Robotics

This repository contains code from my university subject on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Robotics. The code is primarily written in Python and makes extensive use of the TensorFlow library for creating and training neural networks.
Other libraries that come in handy are NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## About Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are the driving force behind image classification, NLP, AI translation, and much more. A neural network takes in inputs, which are then processed in hidden layers using weights that are adjusted during training. Then the model spits out a prediction.

## TensorFlow Library

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.
